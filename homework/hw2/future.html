            <p>Communication has come an amazingly long way since the first electric signals were sent over telegraph. Now, lets try to look into the future a bit and see what new technologies are out there.</p> <br />

                    Quantum physics is one of the most complex fields which seems to defy our understanding of normal physics at every turn. 
                    
                </p>
                <p>One very interesting concept in Quantum mechanics is quantum entanglement, where a change in one particle is directly and equally changed in another</p>
                <p>This has the potential for instantaneous data transmission, no matter the distance.</p>
